    "> There is a strong bias when refering to colors as good or bad. The word and Black and white are both considered negative whilst the color shows that is positive. Also is the notion of sentiment that black and white films are negative does not align with Charlie Chaplin or Fellini fans. There is hint that there is a bias towards blue vs. yellow and the context is not being considered. Yellow is closer to sepia and yet green hue is strongly positive. This is leaning a lot towards randomness and biases that it is trained. Filmakers love green lit projects for a reason :). Also the sa seems to focusing on the individual words considerably more than the context of the sentence. We demonstrate this with the contrasting results between Green and Blue color films, hue and then ordered differently in the sentence. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> In Bert it is strongly nuetral which makes sense , and much narrower , and no sentiment associated on the colors and that is improving on distill bert. And that is interesting to color therapy and calmer themes on green and blue and the soft color for sentiment. Each color is just a wave and frequency and non-humans may perceive. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> The results picked up from `bertweet-base` model look better because the `distilbert-base` is not trained on data that is specific to the source and purpose of twitting. In short, we think that Twitter has its own language or at least a dialect that differs from the common use of the English language. Additionally, Twitter itslef has sub-cultures that are represented within them, for example, movies filmed in Colombia are flagged as negative vs. films filmed in Bollywood. This could be dictated solely in the number of tweets and have nothing pertaining to the underlying quality, emotion or sentiment.  Despite both models are trained for the same task, it seems that `distilbert-base` has been trained on data that might have context biased evaluations as noted by the developer of the model. "

Another novel approach was to test the models on the top 10 funniest/sarcastic/\"best\" tweets as per mashable.com. The results were interestingly strongly negative for these tweets. Some other considerations into the NLP side of things words that indicate probability or likelihood, for example, \"should\" have, \"could\" have and \"will\" have replaced humans by robots were negative.\n",

    "> The example of negation and double negation were both interestingly strongly negative as well, as one would assume whether Elden Ring is plagiarized or not from Skyrim would also have negative or positive sentiments. Controversially, 0.999 positive response for the statement Jeff Bezos is better than Elon Musk. \n",
